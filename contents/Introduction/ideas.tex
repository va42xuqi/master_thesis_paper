To address the research questions, a series of investigations will be conducted. The Transformer model will be compared to other established models in human motion forecasting in \ref{exp:e1}. This includes exploring various context information configurations, such as the exclusion of positional and velocity data in \ref{exp:e2}, and evaluating model performance with shorter historical contexts in \ref{exp:e3}. The performance of multivariate predictors will also be compared to univariate models in \ref{exp:e4}. Additionally, the performance of models will be assessed when predicting movement without social interactions in \ref{exp:e7}. The impact of transfer learning will be tested in \ref{exp:e6}, alongside an analysis of how well each model generalizes to different teams in \ref{exp:e5}.
