\section{Problem Statement}

Predicting human motion in dynamic environments, such as \gls{nba} basketball, \gls{dfl} soccer, and pedestrian scenarios, presents a significant challenge due to the stochastic and highly variable nature of human movement. Accurate motion forecasting is critical for various applications, including enhancing game strategy, reducing injuries, and improving real-time analysis. Existing methods, including traditional Bayesian approaches and various AI models, often struggle to deliver reliable predictions under these complex conditions.

The primary objective of this thesis is to evaluate and identify the most effective model for forecasting the short-term movements of a single target player or individual across high dynamic domains. The research will focus on comparing multiple advanced machine learning models, with a particular emphasis on Transformer models, to determine which model best captures and adapts to the unique movement patterns and behaviors of the target. By systematically assessing the performance of these models under various tasks and scenarios, this thesis aims to overcome the limitations of existing forecasting methods and provide accurate, reliable, and timely predictions in complex, dynamic environments.
