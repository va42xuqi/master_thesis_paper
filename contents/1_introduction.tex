\chapter{Introduction}
This Chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the research undertaken to enhance the forecasting of human motion in team-based sports. It begins by addressing the motivation behind this study and outlines the specific problem statement that drives the inquiry (see Section \ref{sec:motivation}). Following this, the Chapter articulates the research questions that guide the investigation (see Section \ref{sec:research_questions}), highlighting the key areas of focus that emerge from the problem statement.

Subsequently, the proposed solutions to these questions are discussed, detailing the methodologies and models applied in this research (see Section \ref{sec:solution}). This is followed by an examination of the findings derived from the analysis, offering insights into the effectiveness of the various approaches explored (see Section \ref{sec:findings}). Finally, the Chapter concludes with an outline of the subsequent Sections, summarizing how the research contributes to the broader field of human motion forecasting and the implications of the findings for future work (see Section \ref{sec:outline}).
